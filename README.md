### Amazon Website Clone

**Project Overview:**
This project is a front-end clone of the Amazon website, focusing on replicating the look and feel of the Amazon home page. The clone is built using HTML and CSS, aiming to closely match Amazon’s design layout, structure, and responsive features.

**Key Features:**

1. **Header Section:**
   - Fully functional navigation bar with Amazon’s branding.
   - Search bar with placeholder text.
   - Account, Orders, and Cart sections are visibly replicated, each leading to corresponding pages (with placeholder links).
   - Language and location settings displayed, mimicking the dropdown menus found on Amazon.

2. **Main Section:**
   - Banner carousel with multiple slides, showcasing promotional images and text similar to the real Amazon.
   - Product categories are displayed in sections, each featuring images, product descriptions, and redirection links (non-functional in this version).
   - Grid layout of products displayed on sale, styled with hover effects for each product card.
  
3. **Footer Section:**
   - Multi-column footer, similar to the one on the Amazon website, containing links to various help sections, company information, and social media icons.
   - Fully responsive and scalable to different screen sizes.

**Technology Stack:**
- **HTML5**: Used to structure the webpage and define different sections such as the header, navigation bar, product grids, and footer.
- **CSS3**: Utilized for styling the page, adding responsive design elements, animations, and hover effects. Flexbox and grid layout were extensively used for organizing content.

**Responsiveness:**
The website clone was designed with a mobile-first approach, ensuring that the layout adjusts according to different screen sizes. Media queries were used to provide appropriate scaling for mobile, tablet, and desktop users.

**Challenges Faced:**
- Aligning the navigation and product sections to ensure pixel-perfect design.
- Managing responsive layouts to ensure the webpage maintains its functionality and aesthetic on smaller screens.
- Implementing complex hover effects to mimic the interactive elements of the original Amazon site.

**Future Enhancements:**
- Adding interactivity using JavaScript for functionality like dropdown menus, working search bar, and product filtering.
- Implementing the back-end logic to make the site fully functional, integrating with databases for product search and order functionalities.

**How to Run:**
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any browser to view the Amazon clone webpage.
